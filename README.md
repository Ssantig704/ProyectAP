In this repository, Ricardo and Santiago will upload the files.

Code1.A6 Pointers: This file code uses pointers and dynamic memory to work with an array of integers, performs some operations with the array elements and finally frees the dynamically allocated memory to avoid memory leaks.

Code 2.A9 OPP:The code demonstrates key concepts of object-oriented programming, such as inheritance, polymorphism, and the use of abstract classes. In addition, it illustrates how pointers and virtual functions can be used to work with objects of derived classes through pointers to the base class.

Code 3.Bubble: It implements the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers called 'arr' with a size of 5. The swap function is responsible for exchanging two elements in the array, and the printArray function prints the elements of the array.

Code 4. Overload operators: This C++ code defines a Product class representing products with attributes like name, price, and quantity. It demonstrates various object-oriented programming concepts.

Code 5. Farm Exersice: The main purpose is to showcase the use of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism. Each animal has common behavior (makeSound()) inherited from the base class (Animal), as well as specific behavior implemented in their respective classes.
